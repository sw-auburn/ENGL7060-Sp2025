<h1>Carter Dome</h1>

<p>Carter Dome, or simply The Dome, is a mountain located in Coos County, New Hampshire. 
  The mountain is part of the Carter-Moriah Range of the White Mountains, which runs along the
   northern east side of Pinkham Notch. Carter Dome is flanked to the northeast by Mount Hight 
   and to the southwest by Wildcat Mountain (across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Carter_Notch" target=_blank>Carter Notch</a>).</p>

<p>The origins of Carter Dome's name is unknown. Local folklore suggests 
  that it was named after a hunter named Carter, while a neighboring peak is 
  named after his hunting partner, Hight.</p>

<p>The mountain is ascended from the west by the Carter Dome Trail and Nineteen Mile Brook Trail,
   and from the east by the Black Angel Trail.</p>
